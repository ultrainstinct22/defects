Bonjour Sébastien,

Je me permet de vous contacter en tant que responsable technico-fonctionnel de l’application AUTODOC pour avoir quelques clarifications au sujet du ticket « 2010V54209 »

Nous l’avons reçu le 16/10 pour un UT en erreur sur la DR XN , mais il n’est plus affecté à notre EDS  . En vérifiant , il s’avère que le problème est toujours d’actualité .Souhaitez -vous qu’on le traite ?

D’avance Merci pour votre confirmation.

Pour analyser ce problème, j’ai dû prendre quelques références et vérifier sur quelle DR elles sont ( cette information n’était pas sur le fichier Excel , j’ai parcouru 32 DRs !) . J’ai vérifié ensuite  si les OTs en question sont bien reçus et traités par AUTODOC , et si ce dernier a envoyé le CR pour chacune des références . Aucun problème constaté , AUTODOC semble fonctionner normalement  (voir le tableau ci-dessous et les captures d’écran en pj)

j'ai fait ce matin le renvoi des fichiers des DRs AF et HS vers OSIRIS.

Je vous explique ci-dessous les circonstances de cet incident :

Chaque soir et pour chaque DR on a une heure précise de génération et envoi de fichiers .Nous avons eu hier une opération qui nécessitait l'arrêt/démarrage des DR . Le timing de cette opération coïncidait avec l'heure de génération des  fichiers pour AF et HS ce qui a empêché la génération de ces fichiers et ensuite leur envoie bien évidemment .
